## Story:		
		
   12th July 1680: 
   We left London in fine weather on the East India Company vessel Sea Horse. I am working as a deckhand for Captain John Bramble.
   
   19th July 1680: 
   We lost our first crewmate today, he was caught stealing from the ships stores. Captain Bramble is a brutal man he cast him adrift in a jolly boat.
   
   4th August 1680: 
   Yet another example of the Captain’s brutality, three men flogged for not saluting a Midshipman.Perhaps these brutal acts come from his time in the Navy fighting the Dutch?
   
   21st August 1680: 
   Moral among the men has fallen, I am beginning to regret taking this journey to the Americas. There are mutterings of mutiny...
   
   30th August 1680: 
   The Captain is dead, thrown overboard. A man named Kidd is now Captain. We are now heading for the Port of Kingston.
   
   15th September 1680: 
   Land has been spotted, I need to get off this ship.
   
   You leap from the ship and starting swimming for a small island. You drag yourself ashore, you’ve lost your sword, gun and all your supplies. 
   But at least you still have  your hat...Now it is time to find out where you have washed ashore.
